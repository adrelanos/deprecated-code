## This script needs to run before 20_sanity_checks, because debsums would
## otherwise output:
##     perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
##             LANGUAGE = "",
##             LC_ALL = (unset),
##             LANG = "en_GB.UTF-8"
##         are supported and installed on your system.
##     perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").' = '' ']'
## Which is a confusing warning and considered an error in 20_sanity_checks.
